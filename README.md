[00:40.64] She had a face straight out a magazine
[00:59.64] 
[00:50.31] God only knows but you'll never leave her
[01:10.81] 
[00:59.98] Her balaclava is starting to chafe
[01:16.98] 
[01:07.45] When she gets his gun he's begging, babe stay, stay
[01:13.50] Stay, stay, stay
[01:21.50] 
[01:16.94] I'll give you one more time
[01:21.58] We'll give you one more fight
[01:26.52] Said one more line
[01:31.07] Will I know you?
[01:39.07] 
[01:43.15] Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
[02:03.65] 
[01:52.67] And if you never eat, you'll never grow
[02:12.17] 
[02:02.22] You've got a pretty kind of dirty face
[02:21.22] 
[02:10.36] And when she's leaving your home
[02:12.14] She's begging you to stay, stay
[02:15.72] Stay, stay, stay
[02:23.72] 
[02:19.24] I'll give you one more time
[02:24.01] We'll give you one more fight
[02:29.11] Said one more line
[02:32.22] There'll be a riot, cause I know you
[02:50.22] 
[02:41.02] Well now that you've got your gun
[02:45.73] It's much harder now the police have come
[02:50.80] And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
[02:55.38] But if you just take off your mask
[03:12.38] 
[02:59.27] You'd find out everything's gone wrong
[03:08.45] Now everybody's dead
[03:12.60] And they're driving past my old school
[03:17.94] And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
[03:23.15] She says, babe, you look so cool
[03:39.15] 
[03:30.76] You look so cool
[03:35.70] You look so cool
[03:43.70] 
[03:45.19] You look so cool
[03:50.21] You look so cool
[03:55.10] You look so cool
