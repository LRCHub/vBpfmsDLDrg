She had face straight outta magazine
God only knows, but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun
he's begging 'Babe, stay - stay'
'I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
One more line - cause I know you'
Now if you never shoot you'll never know
And if you never eat you'll never grow
You got a pretty kind of dirty face
And when she's leaving your home
she's begging you 'Stay'
'I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
One more line - there'll be a riot
cause I know you'
'Well now that you've got your gun,
it's much harder now the police have come.
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask,
but if you just take off your mask
you'd find out that everything's gone
wrong'.
Now everybody's dead -
and they're driving past my old school
He's got his gun -
He's got his suit on
And she says
'Babe. You look so cool'
