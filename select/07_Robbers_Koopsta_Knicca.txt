I got money on my mind
Bitch, I'm blinded by the dollar signs
I'll work a fucking 9 to 5 instead of signing dotted lines
By 9 to 5 I mean I've come to paint the town grey with 5 fucking 9s
I'm trying to take what's mine
Which happens to be everything that I see
Might be selfish of me
But, if I don't pick a side someone else is getting cash and pine
Dine and dash
Scraps is rationed
Slash and gash
Scratching rashes
Catching rats and slash it's throat
End up like a maxi pad soaked

Haven't had to kill yet but I was born a murderer
Triple 6 my nation I'm the red devil's chosen one
Break in through the back
Give a fuck bout your burglar bars
When I was 17 remember when we would burglar cars
My favorite gun that .45
I love how it bust
Smoke leaking out your chest
Body stuffed in the trunk
I'm ridin' round in Hollygrove
Best believe I got that strap
Can't fuck with you bitches but Oddy got my back
