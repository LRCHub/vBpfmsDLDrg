Little robbers on my mind
Little robbers gonna steal me blind
If I don't watch out

Little robbers on my block
Little robbers gonna pick my lock
If I don't watch out

Little robbers
Do beware
Little robbers
They don't care
Little robbers
Are everywhere
Little robbers
Just sit there an' go yea yea yea
They go yea yea yea

Take my suitcase off my back
I put it down a second and it don't come back
Little robbers
Reach in the pocket to get some change
No change no pocket and no gold ring
Little robbers

Little robbers
Do beware
Little robbers
They don't care
Little robbers
Are everywhere
Little robbers
Just sit there an' go yea yea yea
They go yea yea yea

Little robbers
Do beware
Little robbers
They don't care
Little robbers
Are everywhere
Little robbers
Just sit there an' go yea yea yea
They go yea yea yea

Work so hard to get ahead
Maybe just give to them instead
Little robbers
Little robbers don't be that way
Little robbers you're gonna pay
Little robbers
Little robbers
Do beware
Little robbers
They don't care
Little robbers
Are everywhere
Little robbers
Just sit there an' go yea yea yea
They go yea yea yea
They go yea yea yea
